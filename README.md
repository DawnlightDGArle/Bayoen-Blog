# The Bayoe~n Blog Project

## About This Project

Private Repository for my website. I started this website as a bit of a side hustle project that started as a bit of a joke before I started university as a Computer Science Major. That "joke" of "I'm going to program my own website to prove you don't need services like Wix or Squarespace to create a good looking functional website." ended up turning out to be quite fun in my little Computer Science heart and I ended up turning this joke of an originally 1 page project into a full fledged functional archival blog website. This will likely be something I constantly work on throughout university while completing my major, so updates will come whenever I get around to working on this side hustle of a newfound hobby project. Languages I'm using to develop and program the site currently include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and the site has plans to be hosted with Netlify's website hosting services!

The Bayoen Blog is an archival blog dedicated to archiving the nuances of merchandise for the Japanese video game series *Madou Monogatari* and *Puyo Puyo*. This blog aims to cover as much material as possible while also presenting it to a western audience who otherwise would not have access to the information. The Bayoen Blog serves as a bridge between the knowledge gap for western and Japanese fan of the series and aims to tie up loose ends by documenting, archiving and presenting as much obscure and nuance information about merchandise for these series as possible.

Project Start Date: August 2nd, 2021

Project End Date: TBD
