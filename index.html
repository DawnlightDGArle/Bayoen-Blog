					<u><b> SITE NOTICES </b></u>

					<br> 2022.01.10 - The Bayoe~n Blog has added new accessibility features for users using keyboards. To access the new Skip Navigation
					button, press 'tab' upon loading our website and the option to skip the navigation menu will appear. The Bayoe~n Blog is also continuously
					working on modifying the site to be as responsive as possible on mobile. We ask that any new issues as a result please be reported to our site
					admins through our <a href = "Main Pages/contact.html">About Us/Contact page</a> as soon as possible. </br>

					<br> 2021.10.23 - We are aware that there are currently graphical issues on mobile with our site, including issues with
					the FAQ boxes being too small to read, forcing a side scroll and having spaced out and messed up assets. We are currently working
					on a fix to this and rest assure, the rest of the site should still be pretty optimised for mobile devices. We apologise for any inconvenience
					caused and recommend that any and all bugs/errors/glitches with our site on mobile be reported as soon as possible so they can be fixed.</br>

					<br> 2021.09.22 - The Bayoe~n Blog is pleased to share the news that responsive web design for the site is in
					active development and several issues with how the site displays on mobile have been identified and are receiving
					active fixes, some of these issues being that elements go off the page on some pages and text fonts being too small
					for readability on certain sized devices. We thank all users affected for their patience as we continue to rework the
					website and accommodate for mobile users and we once again apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result. </br>
