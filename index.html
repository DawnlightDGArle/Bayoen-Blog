					<u><b> SITE NOTICES </b></u>

					<br> 2021.10.23 - We are aware that there are currently graphical issues on mobile with our site, including issues with
					the FAQ boxes being too small to read, forcing a side scroll and having spaced out and messed up assets. We are currently working
					on a fix to this and rest assure, the rest of the site should still be pretty optimised for mobile devices. We apologise for any inconvenience
					caused and recommend that any and all bugs/errors/glitches with our site on mobile be reported as soon as possible so they can be fixed.</br>

					<br> 2021.09.22 - The Bayoe~n Blog is pleased to share the news that responsive web design for the site is in
					active development and several issues with how the site displays on mobile have been identified and are receiving
					active fixes, some of these issues being that elements go off the page on some pages and text fonts being too small
					for readability on certain sized devices. We thank all users affected for their patience as we continue to rework the
					website and accommodate for mobile users and we once again apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result. </br>

					<br> 2021.09.05 - As of this date, The Bayoe~n Blog is pleased to announce that a fix has been
					implemented that has better optimised the site for usage on mobile devices as small as 320px in
					screen resolution (minus a few wonky elements that are being evaluated at this moment in time and
					have a fix being implemented to display them properly on mobile). Thank you for your patience as we
					evaluated and implemented a fix and we once again apologise for any inconvenience this issue has caused
					to our mobile users. </br>
