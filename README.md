Captain's Log - 2021.09.03

Private Repository for my website. I started this website as a bit of a side hustle project I decided to start as a bit of a joke before I started university as a Computer Science
Major. That "joke" of "I'm going to program my own website to prove you don't need shit like Wix or Squarespace to create a good looking functional website." ended up turning out
to be quite fun in my little Computer Science heart and I ended up turning this joke of a project into a full fledged functional archival blog website. This will likely be
something I constantly work on throughout university while completing my major, so updates will come whenever I get around to working on this side hustle of a newfound hobby
project.

Project Start Date: August 2nd, 2021
