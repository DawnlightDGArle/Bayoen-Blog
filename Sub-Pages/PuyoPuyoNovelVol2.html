                    <u>Summary</u>
                    <br/>
                    On her way to school, Amitie finds a colorful box sealed with unknown magic, which she hands to person after person in an attempt to open it and find out who the real owner is. Eventually, her and Carbuncle manage to open the box by mistake, 
                    and it turns out to be a cursed artifact Schezo had retrieved from a ruin, the prison of the legendary dream mist! Now everyone who touched the box is in danger of being cursed to a never-ending sleep that manifests their dreams into reality. 
                    Amitie, Arle and Ringo need to try and wake up all the dreamers so they and Schezo can seal the mist back in the box where it belongs...
