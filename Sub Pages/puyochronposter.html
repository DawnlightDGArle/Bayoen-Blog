            An advertising poster advertising the release of Nintendo 3DS title, <i>Puyo Puyo Chronicle</i>. Released as the 25th anniversary title for the <i>Puyo Puyo</i> series on December 8th, 2016,
            the game featured an RPG mode that integrated the mechanics of <i>Puyo Puyo</i> as well as including a party system, items, skills and other elements commonly found in most JRPG titles and having 6 dungeons to explore and conquer.
            The game also featured two new characters, protagonist Ally and main antagonist, Rafisol, as well as also having a series of unique side quests involving most of the cast including the two new characters.

            <br>
            <br>

            The poster itself is unique in that it specifically chooses to advertise the game's "Anniversary Edition", which included 3 bonus discs containing OST from the game and a special 25th Anniversary Drama CD featuring Ally.
            The poster also features two screenshots, neither of which do a particularly great job of accurately representing <i>Puyo Puyo Chronicle's</i> main selling point, the RPG main story mode, as both screenshots only
            show dialouge between Arle and the Mayor of Grimp Town and Arle opening a chest in Warmly Volcano respectively as opposed to the actual in-game battle or skills systems.
