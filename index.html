		<p class="secondary"> <b> About The Bayoe~n Blog </b>
		
		<br>The Bayoe~n Blog was created by a passionate collector of all things
			COMPILE and SEGA era Madou Monogatari and Puyo Puyo in an attempt to
			show off, document and educate on all of the things that have released 
			from these two video game series and eras. Think like a Madou Monogatari
			or Puyo Puyo version of a site like Sonic Gear. However, as you can see, this
			website isn't quite finished yet, so be sure to check back here and there to
			see the development of our site and see the pages that we do have available!
			Please check the site notices down below as well for more information regarding
			the site's current functionaly and development.</br>
