        <header>How To Use Our Database</header>
        <p>Usage of our database is quite simple. Just select a section from the navigation side bar and it will automatically
        jump to that section in our database. Browse through the listed sub-sections and select an item from the sub-section lists,
        click the link and you will be taken to a dedicated page for the archived media, where you can then choose to view the file
        in Google Drive for download purposes, see who the archive contribution is credited to, etc. Please note that manual scans due to
        using the PDF file format, when clicked on, will redirect you automatically to the file in a publically accessible Google Drive folder.
