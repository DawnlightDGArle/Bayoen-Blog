					<h3> About Us </h3>
				The Bayoe~n Blog is a blog dedicated to showcasing and archiving more of the nuance merchandise
				from the video game series, <i>Madou Monogatari</i> and <i>Puyo Puyo</i>. The blog was started on a bit
				of a whim, when the developer of the blog wanted a way to showcase her collection and new additions while
				also wanting to prove at the same time why she believed that website builders such as Wix and SquareSpace
				were in her opinion scams. Thus, the Bayoe~n Blog was formed. Starting off as a side hustle passion project
				during the developer's university years, the blog eventually grew and changed into what it is today: your 
				one stop to learn about everything Madou and Puyo merchandise! We're proud of that history and very excited
				that we can be your one stop to learn so much more about the merchandising scene of these two video game series
				and we hope that whether you're here out of curiosity or a hardcore collector looking to scout out what's out
				there or even if you're someone who knows nothing about either video game series, that no matter what, you enjoy
				what we do and appreciate our blog for what it is: Your Local Madou Puyo Merch Archive. - The Bayoe~n Blog
				
				<br></br> Below you will find introductions for members of our blog's team. Whether these team members do back-end development
				for the site or even just contribute large amounts of images for the site on a regular basis, at the heart of it all is a
				team of very passionate and dedicated people and we'd like nothing more than to introduce some of these people to you!
