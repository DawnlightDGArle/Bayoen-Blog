		An advertising poster used to advertise the release of Drama CD Puyo Puyo Volume 5. Released sometime in
		November 2013, the poster features the album artwork for the drama cd and proudly displays the release date 
		on the front side, while on the back side, the poster goes into more specific details, mentioning the track list,
		MSRP price and voice actor credits. The poster interestingly enough also has a website link on the bottom of the
		back side. A quick investigation of the site revealed that it was a site that you could only access if you were a
		store owner looking to order more of the posters, which confirms that these posters were found in the windows of likely
		audio CD and/or video game stores.
