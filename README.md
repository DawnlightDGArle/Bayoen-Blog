# The Bayoe~n Blog Project

## About This Project

Private Repository for my website. I started this website as a bit of a side hustle project that started as a bit of a joke before I started university as a Computer Science Major. That "joke" of "I'm going to program my own website to prove you don't need services like Wix or Squarespace to create a good looking functional website." ended up turning out to be quite fun in my little Computer Science heart and I ended up turning this joke of an originally 1 page project into a full fledged functional archival blog website. This will likely be something I constantly work on throughout university while completing my major, so updates will come whenever I get around to working on this side hustle of a newfound hobby project. Languages I'm using to develop and program the site currently include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP and the site has plans to be hosted with an SSL certificate via HostGator's website hosting services!
