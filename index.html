					<!--<b> About The Bayoe~n Blog </b>

					<br>The Bayoe~n Blog was created by a passionate collector of all things
					COMPILE and SEGA era Madou Monogatari and Puyo Puyo in an attempt to
					show off, document and educate on all of the things that have released
					from these two video game series and eras. Think like a Madou Monogatari
					or Puyo Puyo version of a site like Sonic Gear. However, as you can see, this
					website isn't quite finished yet, so be sure to check back here and there to
					see the development of our site and see the pages that we do have available!
					Please check the site notices down below as well for more information regarding
					the site's current functionaly and development.</br>-->

					<br> <b> To follow the development of our website or see some of our stuff before it ends up here, check here at our Twitter page <a href="https://twitter.com/BayoenBlogger" , target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @BayoenBlogger! </a> </b> </br>

					<u><b> SITE NOTICES </b></u>
					<br> 2021.09.22 - The Bayoe~n Blog is pleased to share the news that responsive web design for the site is in
					active development and several issues with how the site displays on mobile have been identified and are receiving
					active fixes, some of these issues being that elements go off the page on some pages and text fonts being too small
					for readability on certain sized devices. We thank all users affected for their patience as we continue to rework the
					website and accommodate for mobile users and we once again apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result. </br>

					<br> 2021.09.05 - As of this date, The Bayoe~n Blog is pleased to announce that a fix has been
					implemented that has better optimised the site for usage on mobile devices as small as 320px in
					screen resolution (minus a few wonky elements that are being evaluated at this moment in time and
					have a fix being implemented to display them properly on mobile). Thank you for your patience as we
					evaluated and implemented a fix and we once again apologise for any inconvenience this issue has caused
					to our mobile users. </br>

					<br> 2021.08.21 - As our site goes under constant maintenance, please note that this site is
					currently <b>not optimised</b> for mobile devices and thus some elements may display and/or
					function incorrectly. We are working hard to best optimise the site for mobile devices
					and we kindly ask that if you are able to, please view this site via a desktop, laptop
					or tablet device for the best display/functionality results. We deeply apologise for
					any inconvenience this may have caused, but rest assure that a resolution is on its way
					and is in active development by our website master.</br>
